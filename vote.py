# Project: 
# Create a secure, transparent, anonymized, convinient online voting system
# for using in Avery House. This system interfaces Google surveys with 
# Python for a clean front end and back end. The voting system uses the 
# IRV (instnt runoff voting) strategy. 
#
# When the script finds that the voting period has ended, an email will be
# sent to all voters in the survey, informing them of the results and of 
# all the other voters who participated in the survey]
#
# See the README.md for more information
#
# Prerequisites: 
# Manual survey creation on the Google Forms website 
# required. Several gmail configuration steps and library installations are 
# required to get this working on a fresh project. See README.md
